<h2>Zeros and Sharps is a turn based game with a little roughlike energy inside!<br>
It plays in the console/terminal window with music, sound effects and pixel art graphics!</h2>
<br>
<p>
In the <i>"0&# converter"</i> folder is a editor for creating sprites for the game,<br>
in the editor there's 16 colors <i>(due to limitations with working inside the console window)</i><br>
and 4 diffrent pixel types!
</p>
<p>
The Project is <i>finnished</i> and right now im not planning to do any:<br>
<ul>
  <li>bug fixes,</li>
  <li>new content</li>
  <li>update the sprite editor</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
Modify how much you want!<br>
you can give credit but dont have to, but it would be appreciative!
